**Location:** `../example_projects/example_python/performance_issues.py:19`

**Type:** Architecture

**Description:**
Magic number detected: `100000`. Unnamed numbers make code harder to understand.

**Code Snippet:**
```python
large_list = list(range(100000))
```

**Solution:**
Define named constants with meaningful names: MAX_RETRIES = 3 instead of just 3.

#### Magic Number

**Location:** `../example_projects/example_python/performance_issues.py:71`

**Type:** Architecture

**Description:**
Magic number detected: `001`. Unnamed numbers make code harder to understand.

**Code Snippet:**
```python
time.sleep(0.001)  # Simulate work
```

**Solution:**
Define named constants with meaningful names: MAX_RETRIES = 3 instead of just 3.

#### Magic Number

**Location:** `../example_projects/example_python/performance_issues.py:138`

**Type:** Architecture

**Description:**
Magic number detected: `01`. Unnamed numbers make code harder to understand.

**Code Snippet:**
```python
time.sleep(0.01)  # Simulate network latency
```

**Solution:**
Define named constants with meaningful names: MAX_RETRIES = 3 instead of just 3.

#### Magic Number

**Location:** `../example_projects/example_python/performance_issues.py:168`

**Type:** Architecture

**Description:**
Magic number detected: `100`. Unnamed numbers make code harder to understand.

**Code Snippet:**
```python
temp_list = list(range(100))
```

**Solution:**
Define named constants with meaningful names: MAX_RETRIES = 3 instead of just 3.

#### Potentially Unused Import

**Location:** `../example_projects/example_python/performance_issues.py:5`

**Type:** Architecture

**Description:**
Import may be unused: `import time...`. Unused imports add clutter.

**Code Snippet:**
```python
import time
```

**Solution:**
Remove unused imports to keep code clean. Use tools like autoflake or ruff.

#### Magic Number

**Location:** `../example_projects/example_python/security_issues.py:62`

**Type:** Architecture

**Description:**
Magic number detected: `16`. Unnamed numbers make code harder to understand.

**Code Snippet:**
```python
token = ''.join([str(random.randint(0, 9)) for _ in range(16)])
```

**Solution:**
Define named constants with meaningful names: MAX_RETRIES = 3 instead of just 3.

#### Potentially Unused Import

**Location:** `../example_projects/example_python/security_issues.py:6`

**Type:** Architecture

**Description:**
Import may be unused: `import os...`. Unused imports add clutter.

**Code Snippet:**
```python
import os
```

**Solution:**
Remove unused imports to keep code clean. Use tools like autoflake or ruff.

#### Potentially Unused Import

**Location:** `../example_projects/example_python/security_issues.py:9`

**Type:** Architecture

**Description:**
Import may be unused: `import sqlite3...`. Unused imports add clutter.

**Code Snippet:**
```python
import sqlite3
```

**Solution:**
Remove unused imports to keep code clean. Use tools like autoflake or ruff.

---

#### Magic Number

**Location:** `../example_projects/example_python/style_issues.py:12`

**Type:** Architecture

**Description:**
Magic number detected: `79`. Unnamed numbers make code harder to understand.

**Code Snippet:**
```python
# Issue: Lines too long - exceeds PEP 8's 79 character recommendation
```

**Solution:**
Define named constants with meaningful names: MAX_RETRIES = 3 instead of just 3.

---

#### Magic Number

**Location:** `../example_projects/example_python/style_issues.py:46`

**Type:** Architecture

**Description:**
Magic number detected: `12`. Unnamed numbers make code harder to understand.

**Code Snippet:**
```python
return self.name + self.value  # Issue: Wrong indentation (12 spaces)
```

**Solution:**
Define named constants with meaningful names: MAX_RETRIES = 3 instead of just 3.

---

#### Magic Number

**Location:** `../example_projects/example_python/style_issues.py:74`

**Type:** Architecture

**Description:**
Magic number detected: `0825`. Unnamed numbers make code harder to understand.

**Code Snippet:**
```python
return amount * 0.0825  # What is 0.0825?
```

**Solution:**
Define named constants with meaningful names: MAX_RETRIES = 3 instead of just 3.
